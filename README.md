# MarsRover
Mars Terrain Navigation System with Algorithmic Optimization 

Terrain navigation system for a Mars rover, leveraging the SimpleAI library to implement and evaluate multiple pathfinding algorithms, including A*, BFS, DFS, and Greedy Search, on a 2D Martian elevation map. By refining the A* algorithm, the system achieved optimal route planning over a distance of 3,576.9 meters, outperforming other methods in both speed and efficiency for paths up to 10,000 meters. The project also features 3D surface visualizations created with Plotly, incorporating custom cost functions and Euclidean distance heuristics to navigate complex terrain while respecting elevation constraints.
